##Brief description of how the scripts work and what files are in this repo.

##Please see the Codebook.md file for detailed explanations of the run_analysis.R script and the dataset

This repo contains an R script titled run_analysis.R. This R script file processes a raw dataset containing accelerometer data from a
study involving 30 subjects wearing smartphones (equipped with accelerometers) while doing six different physical tasks.

Run_analysis.R processes the raw data from this study into a single consise tidy dataset. This tidy dataset contains the information
pertaining to varables of means and standard deviations. The data is also grouped by subject and physical activity.

The Codebook.md file contains detailed descriptions of how the run_analysis.R script functions. It also contains details on the 
measured variables present in the raw and tidy data. The codebook.md file also contains a link to an even more detailed explanation
of the data from the original conductors of this study.
